            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Kia Ora. I'm David.</p>
            
            <p> I'm a data science student passionate about artificial intelligence, specializing in retrieval-augmented generation, and AI agents. Currently, I'm developing an AI note-taker that uses LLM technologies to help teams capture and retrieve meeting insights more effectively. </p>
            <p>Driven by the potential to solve real-world problems through technology, I'm excited to explore how AI can transform how we work and communicate.</p>
            
            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>"One step at a time."</strong>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                At my core, I believe in trying my absolute hardest in every facet of life. I approach challenges with full commitment, seeing each experience as an opportunity to learn and grow. My goal is simple: to continuously improve and make a meaningful contribution, one step at a time.
