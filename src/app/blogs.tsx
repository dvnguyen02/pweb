      <h4>TLDR: Started doing LeetCode because problem-solving skills are valuable.</h4>
      <p>For the longest time, I thought LeetCode was just for software engineers. As a data science student, I figured my path would be different and focus more on statistics and machine learning. Why would I need to solve algorithm puzzles when I'm building predictive models?</p>
      
      <p>In New Zealand, data science roles often require a lot of years in experience. And for a grad like me to get into that, it is indeed very difficult. More importantly, I realized that strong problem-solving skills are also universal for any roles.</p>
            
      <p>The job market is competitive, and having options is crucial. Many companies, even for data science roles, include algorithmic thinking in their interview process. I want to be prepared for whatever comes my way.</p>
      
      <p>This was the bigger motivator for me. I sometimes struggled to break them down systematically. LeetCode forces you to think step-by-step and consider edge cases, these skills could directly translate to any type of work.</p>
      
      <p>There are days when I look at a medium-level problem and feel completely lost. The jump from easy to medium feels massive sometimes. Dynamic programming problems still make me second-guess myself constantly.</p>

      <h4>TLDR: Data science work is 80% data cleaning and only 20% actual modeling</h4>
      <p>Data science is often portrayed as this glamorous field where you build amazing machine learning models and uncover groundbreaking insights. While that's partially true, the reality is quite different.</p>
      
      <p>After spending countless hours on university projects and a last year internship at NZTA, I've learned that the majority of data science work involves cleaning and preparing data. It's not the most exciting part, but it's absolutely crucial.</p>
  
  <h3>The 80% - Data Cleaning</h3>
  <p>Most of your time will be spent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Handling missing values and outliers</li>
    <li>Standardizing data formats</li>
    <li>Merging datasets from different sources</li>
    <li>Feature engineering and selection</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Real-world data is messy. You'll encounter missing entries, invalid values (like negative frequencies), and outliers that could skew your entire analysis. Ever tried to merge datasets where dates are formatted differently in each file?</p>

  <p>In the real world, your data rarely comes from a single, clean source. You'll pull information from multiple systems that don't always play nicely together. Getting these to work together is very time consuming.</p>
  
  <h3>The 20% - The Glory</h3>
  <p>This is where the magic happens - building models, analyzing results, and extracting insights that can drive real business decisions. You'll experiment with different algorithms, fine-tune parameters, and create visualizations that tell stories.</p>
  
  <p>Perhaps the most rewarding part is translating your findings into actionable insights. Your customer churn model helps retain valuable customers. Your forecasting algorithm optimizes operations. This 20% is where you see the real impact of your work.</p>
  
  <p>Initially, I was disappointed at first, I wanted to jump straight into building neural networks and complex models. But I've come to appreciate why data preparation is so crucial:</p>
  
  <p>No amount of sophisticated modeling can compensate for poor-quality data. The time you invest in cleaning and understanding your data directly impacts the reliability of your insights.</p>
  
  <p>During the data cleaning process, you become intimately familiar with the business domain. You understand the nuances and context that inform better modeling decisions.</p>
  
  <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
  <p>Data science isn't just about building modelsâ€”it's about extracting reliable insights from imperfect information. The 80% spent on data preparation isn't a necessary evil, it's the foundation that makes the 20% of "glory" work possible.</p>
  
  <p>University teaches you the algorithms and theory, but the real world teaches you that communication, and data quality are just as important.</p>
